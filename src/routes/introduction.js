        <h1> About this space</h1>
        Welcome to my humble abode. This project serves as a base for me testing
        cool peices of technology I've found online, or simply things I want to
        learn. A lot of the "projects" on here are essentially meaningless. A
        lot of the examples are copied from tutorials, so don't expect much
        originality. Some of the implimentations were a little harder than the
        end result would lead you to believe. But that was kind of the point
        (learn to do something new, vast amounts of effort, minimal returns).
        Hopefully as time goes on, I'll add cooler examples of things in here.
        The plan is to create a few API's which link to various ML models, and
        also create a few games with Python that can be rendered directly into
        the browser.
        <h1> About Me</h1>
        My name is Sam, I'm 28 and work as a software developer (hard to believe
        by the design of this crummy website I've thrown together). Anyway, this
        is what I look like:
        <br />
        <img
          style={{ padding: "1rem" }}
          alt="me"
          src="https://i.imgur.com/dVACIWa.jpeg"
        />
        <img
          style={{ padding: "1rem" }}
          alt="me2"
          src="https://i.imgur.com/3ZjNMQQ.jpeg"
        />
        <br />
        I'm sure there are prettier people out there.
      </div>
